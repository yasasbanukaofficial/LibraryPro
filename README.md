# ðŸ“– LibraryPro

A command-line application built with Java for efficient library management. LibraryPro helps users manage books, track borrowings, and maintain inventory seamlessly through an intuitive CLI interface.

## ðŸ’£ Before you run this

- Remeber the font size of your code editior might affect the perfect output (Specially data tables) so make it smaller or use CTRL+- to make it smaller so you can see the perfect output

- For better use I already implemented dummy data which might not be useful so you can remove it.

- And the details for the username and the password is already entered to the system as admin (username) and admin123 (password), it can be changed in the main code (Code line - 55)
